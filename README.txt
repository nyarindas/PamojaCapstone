GOAL
The goal of this Capstone is to build a project within a 12 week Software engineering bootcamp, to showcase skills learnt throughout this course. 
These include working with front end, back end technologies, API , Databases , data types, Array, writing functions, control flow, and operators.

Overall Description
Pamoja is a web application seeking to provide a funds drive platform for different donors (including the general public) to donate and track their donations towards worthy causes e.g. food relief, floods etc. It is a platform that offers the donors an opportunity to choose what they want to buy for the afflicted parties and track the progress of their donations. This will encourage increased participation of the general public in fund raising activities since there will be greater transparency.
USER STORY
 A user story is a way of describing a requirement or feature of a software system from the perspective of the end user or customer. It is a short, simple description of a specific functionality or feature of the system that the user needs or wants. Here are some user stories for the website:

 User stories: Donor

By incorporating these user stories into the design and functionality of the website, the organization can make it easy and intuitive for users to donate in a way that suits their preferences and needs, while also providing them with clear information about the impact of their contributions. These are some of the user stories for the user:

1. As a donor who wants to make a difference, I want to be able to donate based on the number of families I can feed, so that I can feel like my contribution is making a real impact. I expect to see clear information about the number of families that can be fed with each donation amount, and I want to be able to easily select the amount I want to donate.
2. As a donor who wants to support specific food baskets, I want to be able to see a list of available food baskets with their associated prices, so that I can choose the one that best fits my budget and preferences. I expect to see clear information about the items included in each food basket, and I want to be able to add them to my cart and checkout quickly and easily.
3. As a donor who wants to purchase specific food items, I want to be able to see a list of available products with their prices, so that I can choose the ones that best fit my needs and preferences. I expect to see clear information about the quantities of each product, and I want to be able to add them to my cart and checkout quickly and easily.
4. As a user who wants to learn more about the impact of my donation, I want to be able to see real-life stories and testimonials from families and individuals who have been helped by the organization. I expect to see clear information about the impact that my donation can have, including the number of meals that can be provided and the amount of food that can be purchased with my contribution.
5. As a user who wants to stay informed about the organization's work, I want to be able to receive regular updates and newsletters about the latest news and events. I expect to see clear information about how my donation is being used and how the organization is making a difference in the lives of those in need.
6. As a user, I want to track my donations. For every basket/item I purchased, I want to see if it actually got to a family in need.


User stories: Administrator

1. As an administrator, I want to be able to manage donations and track progress towards fundraising goals, so that I can ensure that the organization is meeting its targets. I expect to be able to see real-time data about donations, including the number of donations received and the amount of money raised.
2. As an administrator, I want to be able to manage the content of the website, including adding new products and updating information about fundraising goals and progress. I expect to be able to easily edit the website using a user-friendly content management system.
3. As an administrator, I want to be able to manage donor information and communicate with donors, so that I can provide them with updates about the organization's work and acknowledge their contributions. I expect to be able to access and update donor records, as well as send out personalized thank-you messages and newsletters.
4. As an administrator, I want to be able to monitor and analyze website traffic and user behavior, so that I can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions. I expect to be able to use web analytics tools to track user engagement and behavior and generate reports to share with the organization's leadership team.
5. As an administrator, I want to be able to collaborate with other members of the organization, including volunteers and staff, so that we can work together to achieve our fundraising goals. 
By incorporating these user stories into the design and functionality of the website, the administrator can efficiently and effectively manage the website and its various components, allowing the organization to better achieve its fundraising and impact goals.
